# Microblog v2

This is an iteration on my earlier static microblog site.
While the last site was completely static, using HTML and CSS only, this site is fully functional.
Users can create accounts and follow other users.
They can make posts and like other's posts as well.
This serves as my final project for CS 260 at BYU.
